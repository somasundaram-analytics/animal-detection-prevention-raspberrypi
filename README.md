# Animal Detection and Prevention System for Crop Fields Using Raspberry Pi

## Description
This project detects animals entering agricultural fields using computer vision
and triggers an alert system to help prevent crop damage. The system runs on
Raspberry Pi and processes live camera input in real time.

## Problem Statement
Farmers face significant crop losses due to animal intrusion. Manual monitoring
is inefficient and unreliable, especially during night hours.

## Solution
The system uses a camera connected to Raspberry Pi to detect animals using
image processing techniques and activates an alert mechanism when intrusion
is detected.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Raspberry Pi
- NumPy

## Features
- Real-time animal detection
- Automated alert generation
- Low-cost and energy-efficient solution
- Suitable for continuous field monitoring

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi
- USB / Pi Camera
- Buzzer or Alarm
- Power Supply

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
